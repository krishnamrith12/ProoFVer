# Examples of GENRE usage

See examples on how to use GENRE for both pytorch fairseq and huggingface transformers:
* For [pytorch/fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/GENRE/blob/main/examples/fairseq.md)
* For [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/GENRE/blob/main/examples/transformers.md)

**NOTE: we used fairseq for all experiments in the paper. The huggingface/transformers models are obtained with a conversion script similar to [this](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/models/bart/convert_bart_original_pytorch_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py). Therefore results might differ.**
